Live-demo -> https://basketballsboard.netlify.app/

## What I have done;
In this project, I reinforced my knowledge and repeated the topic that I have learnt such script tag, variables, numbers and strings, console.log, how to create functions, how to call/invoke functions from html file, the dom concept, getElementById, innerText and textContent. 

For this project, I didn't like given project(you can check the notes to see given project), I have made some changes and divided control panel and scoreboard. I have added bonus, fouls, shotclock, timer and a reset buttons. It was challenging I have learnt along the way.
